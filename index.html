            <h3>Who Are We?</h3>
                <p>
                    We work closely with local & international consultant brokerage providers that have established relationships with clients 
                    within the financial services, commercial and industrial industries. With a combined 10+ years experience 
                    working internally as recruiters, talent managers and support units, we are able to navigate the complex and 
                    often murky waters and get transparent and clear feedback and insights freelancers have often missed. 
                </p>
                <h3>What do we actually do?</h3>
                <p>With more waves of regulations posed to wash over Europe, one in particular involves transparency around wages. 
                    Banks are demanding companies disclose the pay rate and margins of conventional brokers and service providers. 
                    We are here to be ahead of the curve. We believe all brokerage services should have industry standards and we believe 
                    as brokers, our role is merely as facilitators. In order to put our client first, we should in fact not take 
                    advantage of the trust and loyalty they have granted. 
                </p>

                <p>We established contact Aspenberg began contact while he was on another assignment, he endulged in having a virtual meeting
                    to introduce myself and services. Over the following months, we had presented Aspenbergs profile on several 
                    key projects. Due to the uncertain market, a lot of discussions ground to halts due to budgeting concerns 
                    overall. While working with one of the banks, a key team member in one team was planning to move to a new 
                    team and a replacement was required immidiately to cover his area. Aspenbergs profile was immidiately matched
                    with the role and presented to the manager. 3 working days later, an interview was conducted and offer presented 
                    just 2 days later.

                <h4>Meet Mrs. Done</h4>
                <p>Mrs. Done was recommended to join GigFree from her managers at a consulting services company. We discussed her background
                    and where she felt that she could provide the most value. We started sending some opportunities her way, most sounded 
                    interesting but was not quite the area that she felt able to contribute the most. After only 4 weeks, a large bank requested 
                    a DevSecOps engineer, which suited her skills perfectly. After 1 week we had an interview in place, after a short interview 
                    preparation, she went through the process like a start and just 5 days later was offered a long term placement, where she still sits today,
                    more than a year later.

                <h4>Meet the Techies</h4>
                <p>A global technology company built several new datacenters around the region and required 60 resources to join 
                    their organization on a contract basis to build the server rooms for local clients cloud environments. GigFree 
                    sent out the message to those registered for datacenter technician roles and quickly aligned 20 candidates. Every week since
                    the client first approached us, candidates have been interviewed and accepted into various seniority roles. Despite some 
                    of the challenges around relocating resources, all the freelancers are still working today with one of the most recognizable names 
                    around the world.

                <h4>Remote working ability</h4>
                <p>Although many felt the joy of working from home during the pandemic, often times these days, companies are requesting 
                    people come back to the office to build more committed teams. Having said that, there are increasing opportunities of 
                    clients looking to reduce overheads by having consultants working from near-shore locations. These often involve freelancers 
                    working from home 99% of the time with occassional visists to the company country. When and where possible, we push clients
                    to take advantage of the remote setup and give you the flexbility you so deserve.
