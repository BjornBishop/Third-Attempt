            <h3>Who Are We?</h3>
                <p>
                    We work closely with local & international consultant brokerage providers that have established relationships with clients 
                    within the financial services, commercial and industrial industries. With a combined 10+ years experience 
                    working internally as recruiters, talent managers and support units, we are able to navigate the complex and 
                    often murky waters and get transparent and clear feedback and insights freelancers have often missed. 
                </p>
                <h3>What do we actually do?</h3>
                <p>With more waves of regulations posed to wash over Europe, one in particular involves transparency around wages. 
                    Banks are demanding companies disclose the pay rate and margins of conventional brokers and service providers. 
                    We are here to be ahead of the curve. We believe all brokerage services should have industry standards and we believe 
                    as brokers, our role is merely as facilitators. In order to put our client first, we should in fact not take 
                    advantage of the trust and loyalty they have granted. 
                </p>

                <h4>Meet Mr. Aspenberg</h4>
                <p>Aspenberg and I began contact while he was on another assignment, he endulged in having a virtual meeting
                    to introduce myself and services. Over the following months, we had presented Aspenbergs profile on several 
                    key projects. Due to the uncertain market, a lot of discussions ground to halts due to budgeting concerns 
                    overall. While working with one of the banks, a key team member in one team was planning to move to a new 
                    team and a replacement was required immidiately to cover his area. Aspenbergs profile was immidiately matched
                    with the role and presented to the manager. 3 working days later, an interview was conducted and offer presented 
                    just 2 days later.
