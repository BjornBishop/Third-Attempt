                        <p>
                            Access to freelancing assignments should be just as easy, secure and simple 
                            as regular employment. Thats why I created this space, where freelancers 
                            can keep up to date with key assignments without needing to be interupted 
                            by countless recruiters and brokers about the same opportunity. I help
                            you be independent and provide the tools and environment to exceed.
